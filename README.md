# SoundCheckServer

Server side component composed by multiple servlets.

- FFT: returns the double array containing the magnitude of the frequency spectrum
- Spectrogram: returns a double matrix containing the magnitude per frequency/time
- CheckSound: still work in progress. The idea is to compare a given audio file to the input coming on the servlet (Shazam like)
